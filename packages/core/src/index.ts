// @area-mockups/core — the framework-agnostic heart of area-mockups.
//
// Everything here depends on `three` at most (never on React, Svelte or Vue):
// device/object specs, geometry math, the live-screen behaviors and the shared
// stage configuration. Framework bindings (`area-mockups` for React today;
// `@area-mockups/svelte`, `@area-mockups/vue` later) are thin layers that feed
// this data into their renderer. See ARCHITECTURE.md at the repo root.
