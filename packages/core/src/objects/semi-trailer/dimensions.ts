/**
 * Semi trailer object dimensions — a 53 ft dry van parked on its landing
 * gear (no tractor): the biggest advertising canvas on the road.
 *
 * Proportions follow the US standard: 16.15 m long, 2.6 m wide, a 2.9 m box
 * on a ~1.2 m floor height (4.1 m overall), smooth-sided for wraps, tandem
 * axles at the rear, landing gear behind the kingpin, ICC bumper and DOT
 * reflective tape along the bottom rail. Normalized to ~2485 mm per world
 * unit so the trailer is 6.5 units long.
 *
 * Live surfaces: both smooth sides and the rear doors. The group origin is
 * the box center; the road sits `groundY` below it.
 *
 * This is pure, renderer-agnostic data: the 3D model consumes it today and a
 * future 2D (CSS/SVG) renderer can consume the same numbers.
