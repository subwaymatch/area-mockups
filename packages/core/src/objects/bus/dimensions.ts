 * Bus object dimensions — a generic 40 ft / 12 m low-floor city transit bus
 * (New Flyer Xcelsior / Nova LFS / Mercedes Citaro class, no brand):
 * one-box silhouette with no hood, a near-vertical lightly-raked front, a
 * dark upper fascia band holding the LED destination sign, a window band
 * covering almost half the body height, two full-glass curb-side doors, a
 * flat roof with an HVAC pod, and the classic king-size advertising panel
 * (30" x 144") between the wheels.
 *
 * Normalized to ~1900 mm per world unit: 12.19 x 3.20 x 2.59 m becomes
 * 6.4 x 1.68 x 1.36 units. The group origin sits mid-height at the body
 * center; the ground plane is `groundY` below it. +X is the nose, +Z the
 * curb side carrying the doors and the live ad panel.
 *
 * This is pure, renderer-agnostic data: the 3D model consumes it today and a
 * future 2D (CSS/SVG) renderer can consume the same numbers.
