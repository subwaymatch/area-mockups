/**
 * ID card object dimensions — a portrait CR80 badge on a lanyard.
 *
 * The card is the standard CR80 badge blank: 54 x 85.6 mm held portrait on
 * 30 mil (0.76 mm) PVC with a 14 x 3 mm slot punch centered 6 mm below the
 * top edge. Normalized to ~32 mm per world unit so the card is 2.68 units
 * tall. The lanyard rises from a metal crimp and swivel hook clipped through
 * the slot; the strap halves exit the top of the frame like a hanging badge.
 *
 * This is pure, renderer-agnostic data: the 3D model consumes it today and a
 * future 2D (CSS/SVG) renderer can consume the same numbers.
