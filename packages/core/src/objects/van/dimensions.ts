/**
 * Van object dimensions — a generic Euro-style cargo van (think Transit /
 * Sprinter silhouette, no brand): long-wheelbase panel van with a clamshell
 * hood, cowl break, raked windshield, high roof and a flat cargo side that
 * takes a vinyl-wrap livery.
 *
 * Normalized to ~1050 mm per world unit: 5.9 m long, 2.55 m tall, 2.05 m wide
 * becomes 5.62 x 2.43 x 1.95 units. The group origin sits mid-height at the
 * body center; the ground plane is `groundY` below it. +X is the nose, +Z the
 * curb side carrying the live wrap panel.
 *
 * This is pure, renderer-agnostic data: the 3D model consumes it today and a
 * future 2D (CSS/SVG) renderer can consume the same numbers.
