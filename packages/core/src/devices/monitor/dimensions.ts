/**
 * Monitor device dimensions.
 *
 * Proportions follow the Apple Studio Display (2nd generation, March 2026 —
 * the 2022 enclosure carried over unchanged): 27" 5K 5120x2880 at 600 nits,
 * 623 x 478 x 168 mm on the tilt stand, ~19.5 mm flat-back aluminum slab
 * (362 mm tall bare), all-glass front with a uniform ~13 mm black bezel and
 * only a hairline of aluminum at the edge, centered camera, speaker
 * perforations along the bottom of the back, 2x Thunderbolt 5 + 2x USB-C in
 * a tight rear row (left of center seen from behind), the captive power
 * cord's circular recess centered low on the back, and no power button.
 * Normalized to ~115 mm per world unit, so the enclosure is 5.42 units wide.
 * Origin sits at the panel center; the desk plane is `standHeight` below it.
 *
 * The tilt stand matches the product photography (front, side and rear
 * angles): a wide (~152 mm), thin sheet arm hangs from the hinge — whose
 * machined pivot caps show on the arm's sides — about three quarters of the
 * way down the back, leans a gentle ~13° back down to the knee and runs
 * forward as a thin foot plate on small rubber pads. A single vertical
 * stadium cutout passes clean through the blade straddling the enclosure's
 * bottom edge: the panel's round power inlet shows through its upper half
 * (the dark circle in the rear photography) and the lower half is open air
 * the captive cord drops through.
 *
 * This is pure, renderer-agnostic data: the 3D model consumes it today and a
 * future 2D (CSS/SVG) renderer can consume the same numbers.
