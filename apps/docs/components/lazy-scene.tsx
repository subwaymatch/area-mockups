 * Mounts its children only while the wrapper is near the viewport, and
 * unmounts them once it scrolls well away.
 *
 * Browsers cap the number of live WebGL contexts (as few as 8 on mobile
 * Chrome) and silently kill the oldest context when the cap is exceeded —
 * on a gallery page full of canvases that leaves earlier cards showing the
 * "sad canvas" icon with the CSS3D screen floating detached. Keeping only
 * the nearby scenes mounted stays far under the cap and also skips the GPU
 * cost of rendering off-screen scenes.
 *
 * The wrapper fills its parent, so it must sit inside a container with a
 * fixed height (`.demo-viewport`) for layout to hold while unmounted.
